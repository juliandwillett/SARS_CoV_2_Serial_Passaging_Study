To reproduce results, run the R code line-by-line in the "Main.R" file to process the data (from VCF files available on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/10460451) and produce figures. You can also run the bash code on the raw files, which are in process of being uploaded to the matching Zenodo link.

# Raw Files:
Raw FASTQ format files for the Illumina and Nanopore files used to produce the Zenodo VCF files (after merging the files for the runs) are also available, with links below:
